# ðŸŒ¤ Skycast


## ðŸŽ¨ Colors

For the color palette we used `coolors.co`. The colors we settled on are

```javascript
const skycast={
    Jet : "#353535",
    CaribbeanCurrent:"#3C6E71",
    White:"#FFFFFFF",
    Platinum:"#D9D9D9",
    IndigoDye:"#284B63"
}
```

These colors are also added to the `tailwind.config.ts` file so they can be used easily
